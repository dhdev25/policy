  <h1>Privacy Policy – URL Tracker Extension</h1>

  <p>This extension captures the currently active browser tab URL and sends it via WebSocket to a local desktop agent installed by your organization.</p>

  <p>No information is sent to external services or third-party servers. The extension only communicates with a local application on <code>ws://localhost</code>.</p>

  <p>The desktop agent may store or process the URL data further based on internal organizational policies, such as for time tracking or activity logging. These actions are managed entirely by your company.</p>

  <p>The extension does not access passwords, cookies, files, or any sensitive browser data beyond the visible address bar URL.</p>

  <p>By installing this extension, users agree to this privacy behavior as part of their internal IT compliance.</p>
